- When sizeof() is used with the data types, it simply returns the amount of
  memory allocated to that data type.
  e.g int a; sizeof(a);
  e.g sizeof(char);
    - The output can be different on different machines like a 32-bit system
      can show different output while a 64-bit system can show different of
      same data types.

- When the sizeof() is used with an expression, it returns the size of the
  expression.
  e.g sizeof(a+b);
